## What programming language does Data Scientists use the most?  (from the 2018 Stack Overflow Developer Survey )

(survey with a total of  about 100000 users)

Dataset: <https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/datasets>



##### Programming Language Ranking ( Data scientist or machine learning specialist)

### How are different developers similar to each other in terms of their programming language?

##### We can plot on a 2D space by using MDS(multi dimensional scaling )

what is MDS?

Simply put,  MDS is one of dimensionality reduction algorithms that enable us to plot multidimensional data into a 2-D or a higher dimensional space.

**MDS finds desire points that minimize stress loss, therefore MDS is a good fit for stress values near zero**

 ( Here, dij is actual distance and ||xi-xj|| is predicted distance ( 2D in this example) )
