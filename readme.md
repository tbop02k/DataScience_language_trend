# How similar different developers each other in terms of their programming language?

#### We can plot on 2D space by using MDS(multi dimensional scaling )

what is MDS?

![1554546123790](assets/1554546123790.png)

Simply say,  MDS is one of dimensionality reduction algorithm that enable to plot multidimensional data into 2-D or higher dimensional space.

**MDS find desire points that minimize stress loss. MDS fits with stress values near zero are the best.**

 ( Here, dij is actual distance and ||xi-xj|| is predicted distance ( 2D in this example) )
